### A really crude twitter link replacer for fixupx.com on discord
Built using rust

Don't expect anything magical, I just got tired of always having to edit twitter.com to vxtwitter.com for it to display in discord. This is my first time coding anything real in rust, expect crashes or strange behaviour. 

This will take any twitter post link either `https://x.com` or `https://twitter.com` and change it to `https://fixupx.com` on your clipboard.
